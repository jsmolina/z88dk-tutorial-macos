# z88dk-tutorial-macos
radastan z88dktutorial adapted to MacOS. All the credits and code belong to radastan. I've just adapted the tutorial to Mac.


You'll need z88dk, of course, so you could download it from here:
http://nightly.z88dk.org/

Some utilities have been included for easier management in utilszx, like in the original tutorial

png2sprite.py 
Quick and dirty png to sprite converter. Right now it only uses 1-bit sprites (no color), and ignores color info.
